# crypto-experiments

This repo contains my experiments with cryptography, using Clojure as my
exploratory language. Clojure is concise and powerful, and when combined
with Light Table, makes for an awesome interactive coding playground. If
you are at all interested in cryptography, and perhaps even in Clojure,
this project is currently set up for playing around in Light Table's
InstaREPL. Load the directory into your LT workspace, open `core.clj`
and tell LT to set your editor as an InstaREPL. You can play around with
the functions contained within however you like, and if you want to see
how some of it fits together, there are some functions commented out at
the bottom which allow you to see the flow of code through some
decryption routines.

Enjoy!
